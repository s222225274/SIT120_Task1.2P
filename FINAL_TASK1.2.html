            Responsive Web Design is a method of creating websites that automatically adjust and look fantastic on a wide range of devices, from large desktop screens to small mobile phones. It's similar to making your website "flexible" so that it can adjust its design and size to match any screen. This is crucial because, regardless of the device they're using to access the internet, people use a variety of different gadgets, and they expect websites to be simple to use and understand. A responsive website benefits users and may help it rank higher in search results, as well as providing a better user experience. Due to this, responsive design makes websites flexible and user-friendly for all visitors, regardless of the device they're using.
